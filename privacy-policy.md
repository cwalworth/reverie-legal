# Privacy Policy for Reverie

**Last updated: January 2025**

## Overview

Reverie is a mood-based music player that respects your privacy. We believe your music listening habits are personal, and we've designed our app with privacy as a core principle.

**The short version:** We don't collect, store, or sell your personal data. Everything stays on your device.

---

## Data We Access

### Music Library
- **What:** Song titles, artists, albums, and audio files from your Apple Music library
- **Why:** To display your music and analyze audio features for the Mood Grid
- **Where it goes:** Nowhere. All processing happens on your device. We never upload your music or library information to any server.

### Audio Analysis Data
- **What:** Tempo, energy, and mood coordinates calculated from your songs
- **Why:** To place songs on the Mood Grid and power the Rhythm Game
- **Where it goes:** Stored locally on your device only. Never transmitted.

---

## Optional Features

### Social Listening (Optional)
If you enable the "Social Listening" feature to see how many others are listening to the same song:

- **What we send:** A one-way cryptographic hash of the song title and artist, plus a random anonymous ID generated on your device
- **What we DON'T send:** Actual song names, your Apple ID, location, or any personal information
- **How it works:** The hash cannot be reversed to reveal what you're listening to. We only count how many anonymous users share the same hash.
- **You control it:** This feature is off by default and can be disabled anytime in Settings.

### Lyrics (via LRCLIB)
When you view lyrics, we fetch them from LRCLIB.net, a free open-source lyrics database:
- **What we send:** Song title and artist name
- **Third party:** LRCLIB's privacy policy applies to their service

---

## Data We Do NOT Collect

- Personal information (name, email, phone)
- Apple ID or account information
- Location data
- Usage analytics or tracking
- Advertising identifiers
- Device identifiers (beyond the random anonymous ID for Social Listening)

---

## Data Storage

All app data is stored locally on your device:
- Mood analysis results
- Cached lyrics
- Playlists you create
- App preferences

If you delete the app, all local data is deleted with it.

## Children's Privacy

Reverie does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13. The app accesses only your local music library and does not require account creation.

---

## Changes to This Policy

If we make changes to this privacy policy, we will update the "Last updated" date above. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect personal data, there's nothing to request, correct, or delete on our end. Your music library data stays entirely under your control on your device.
